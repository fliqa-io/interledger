/**
 * Represents a quote for an Interledger payment operation.

 * <p>A quote provides cost estimates and exchange rate information for a payment
 * between two parties. It calculates the exact amounts that will be debited from
 * the sender and received by the recipient, including any fees or currency
 * conversions that may apply.
 *
 * <p>Quotes are essential for providing transparency in payment costs and must
 * be created before executing outgoing payments. They have a limited lifespan
 * and expire after a specified time to ensure exchange rates and fees remain
 * current.
 *
 * <p>This is used in step 3 of the Interledger payment flow to estimate costs
 * before the sender authorizes the payment.

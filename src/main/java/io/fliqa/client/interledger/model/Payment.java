/**
 * Represents a completed or in-progress payment in the Interledger Open Payments protocol.

 * 
 * <p>A payment is the result of successfully executing an outgoing payment request

 *   <li>Create quote (sender)</li>
 *   <li>Create outgoing payment (sender)</li>
 *   <li>Execute payment - this class represents the result</li>

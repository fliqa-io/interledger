# Open API definition

## NOTE

Open API definition was altered due to problems generating code with OpenAPI generator (**/api** and **/api-original**).
Unfortunately the current version of Open API generator could not produce a working API definition.

After **a lot** of lost time, the necessary JSON models were hand coded, as automatic code generation was impossible.

The models in **/io/fliqa/client/model** might not represent the latest version and probably not all models are present.

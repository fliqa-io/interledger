# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with newcomers and helping them learn

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Spam or excessive self-promotion
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Project-Specific Guidelines

In addition to the general standards above, the following guidelines apply specifically to the Interledger Open Payments
API Client project:

### Technical Discussions

* **Stay on Topic**: Keep discussions relevant to the Interledger protocol, payment systems, or the project's technical
  goals
* **Constructive Criticism**: When reviewing code or suggesting improvements, focus on the code and its functionality,
  not the person
* **Security Mindset**: Respect that this project handles financial transactions and cryptographic operations - take
  security discussions seriously
* **Documentation**: Help maintain clear, accurate documentation that benefits all users

### Code Contributions

* **Quality Standards**: Respect the project's commitment to high-quality, well-tested code
* **Review Process**: Participate constructively in code reviews, both as reviewer and contributor
* **Testing**: Understand that comprehensive testing is essential for financial software
* **Dependencies**: Consider the impact of new dependencies on security and maintenance

### Community Interaction

* **Mentoring**: Help newcomers understand the Interledger protocol and project structure
* **Knowledge Sharing**: Share your expertise about payments, cryptography, and Java development
* **Patience**: Remember that financial protocols can be complex - be patient when explaining concepts
* **Inclusivity**: Welcome contributors from all backgrounds and experience levels

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes but is not limited to:

- GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Community forums and chat platforms
- Conference presentations and workshops
- Social media interactions when representing the project
- Email communications related to the project

## Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[conduct@fliqa.io](mailto:conduct@fliqa.io).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Reporting Guidelines

When reporting a violation, please include:

* **What happened**: A clear description of the incident
* **When it happened**: Date and time if possible
* **Where it happened**: Platform, repository, or communication channel
* **Who was involved**: Names or usernames of people involved
* **Evidence**: Links to comments, screenshots, or other documentation
* **Impact**: How the behavior affected you or the community

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality. We will not
share reporter information without explicit consent, except when necessary to
address the violation or as required by law.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code
of Conduct, you may appeal the decision by contacting [conduct@fliqa.io](mailto:conduct@fliqa.io)
with a concise description of your grievance. Appeals will be reviewed by
community leaders who were not involved in the original decision.
